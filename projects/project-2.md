mrdreamsoftice is a web application which I helped create as a portfolio project, Rainy Season 2021. This project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive website.

mrdreamsoftice is implemented using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com
), a Python application platform. Within a week, I created a website that implemented a purchase link via whatsapp business directly to the store, applied the store's Instagram link and shop address.

In this project I gained experience with Front-end application design and related technologies, including [Javascript](http://javascript.com) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Frameworks for user interfaces.
